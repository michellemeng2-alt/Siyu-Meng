<!--Guidelines: 
●  Semantic  structure:  Use  meaningful  HTML  tags  (e.g.,  <header>,  <section>, 
<article>) to ensure the content is logically organised and easy to navigate. 
●  ARIA roles:  Integrate  ARIA  roles  thoughtfully  to  improve  context  and  navigation 
for users relying on assistive technologies. 
●  Images:  Ensure  all  images  have  descriptive  alt  attributes  to  convey  their 
purpose.  Decorative  images  should  have  empty  alt  attributes  (alt="")  to  be 
ignored by screen readers. 
●  Accessible  forms:  Design  a  basic  form  with  clear  labels,  aria-  attributes  for 
improved usability, and proper keyboard accessibility.-->
